I created [Dusk](https://dusk.now.sh) to make my dock look more visually harmonious. [LiteIcon](https://freemacsoft.net/liteicon/) does a great job of automating the icon changing process, but every time I opened Discord, the dock icon reverted back to default. Not cool.

It happens to other Electron applications (Hyper, VSCode) over time. Even Safari reverts back occasionally. It's frustratingly ugly. Let's fix it.

Find the application in Finder and right click to "Show Package Contents".

Navigate to `Contents/Resources/`. Here, `electron.icns` is the culprit. Let's replace it with our custom icon.

We'll need to convert our custom `.png` icon from Dusk (or anywhere else) to an `.icns` file. MacOS ships with the command line tool `sips` to help with this.

Run the following from the command line, replacing ICON as needed.

<CLI>sips -s format icns ICON.png --out ICON.icns</CLI>

Move your new `.icns` file into the previously opened `Resources/` folder. I like to save the old icon by renaming it, just in case I have to revert later. Rename your new file to match the old (in this case, `electron.icns`).

Restart the app, and your custom application icon should persist!
